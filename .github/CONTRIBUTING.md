## How to contribute to scAR

#### **Where to find the documentation?**

* If you want to try **scAR**, [first check the documentation](https://scar-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Be aware of the versions.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Novartis/scAR/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Novartis/scAR/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. **Don't mark it [semantic versioning label](https://github.com/Novartis/scAR/labels), this may make a new release**

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.

#### **Do you have questions about scAR documentation?**

* Discuss any non-code question about scAR in the [readthedocs discussion](https://scar-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contacts.html#comments).
